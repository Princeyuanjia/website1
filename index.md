			<h2>What's the movie's background and theme?</h2>
			<p4>
				<h3>Background:
				The story began in the last years of Song Dynesty,which succeeded the last time line from the first movie when Blanca fell in love with Xu xuan.But the story was more likely a succeeding part of Qingshe which was directed by Xu Ke,in which Fa Hai,a monk,asked Qingshe to tempt him.But he failed to keep his own heart because Qingshe's appearance was really alluring.As to disguise his fault,he banned the love in people and forced Bai Suzhen to divorce with Xu xuan.To leave a fine ending(but actually not),Xu xuan was determined to join to be a monk.This movie was established at this time line when Blanca wanted to save her husband by flowing the Jinshan Temper.
				</h3>
				<h3>Theme:
				The movie demonstrated the affectionate feelings between sisters,which might be the most moving part.Besides,it also showed that one person should rely on himself but not others,which meaned that we should be strong enough to make our own living but not begged other for help.Verta's courage,loyal and beauty all presented ideal characters that were example for us.

			<h2>Where were the polarized points?</h2>
			<div>Positive:</div>
			<p5>Some people(including the writer)may think that the movie could be regraded as one of the most meaningful movies in Chinese carton movie industry.The spirit value in this movie was so high but moved that almost all the audience would be moved to tears when it came to the end.The different parts diverted naturally and the technique was a huge surprising.Although there might be still some unnecessary scenes in the movie,this one was sure to lift everyone's spirits.</p5>
			<div>Negative:</div>
			<p6>Some people thought that there were a lot of waste information and some supporting roles were unnecessary.Besides,the theme was unclear and the thought of Verta was ridiculous and subjective,even might not meet with the appreciation of beauty today.</p6>
